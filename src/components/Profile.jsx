            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>This is Yoyo.
                I am a game developer with a passion for creating immersive experiences.               
                For my past work experience, I held a leadership role at an online service-matching company and a healthcare agency platform. 
                </p>

            <h4>Qualification</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Advanced Diploma in Game Programming from Centennial College, Toronto, Canada</li>
                <li>Bachelorâ€™s Degree in China Studies (Economics) from Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fast Learner</h4>
            <p>My transition from Economics to Game Programming demonstrates that I am capable of quickly acquiring new knowledge. 
                Additionally, my experience working in start-up companies required me to manage different parts of team operations without guidance. 
                This meant I had to independently search for resources to accomplish my tasks. 
                In the fast-changing IT industry, I believe this adaptability is an essential skill for success.</p>

            <h4>Responsible & Organized</h4>
            <p>While working at a healthcare agency, I was responsible for building the entire workflow system for service matching from scratch and establishing a new team. 
                This demonstrates my ability to plan, organize, and allocate resources efficiently. 
                In school, I participated in lots of group projects, where I took the lead in coordinating teammates and managing deadlines, highlighting my time management, responsibility, and communication skills.</p>

            <h4>Skilled at Problem-Solving</h4>
            <p>During my studies, I consistently performed well in mathematics and programming, showcasing my strong problem-solving abilities. 
                As a customer service team leader in my past work experience, I was always the last resort for handling complaints. 
                This experience strengthened my problem-solving skills and ability to manage difficult situations effectively.</p>
