                    <h4>Efficient, Responsible & Organized</h4>
                    <p>
                        While working at a healthcare agency, I was responsible for building the entire workflow system for service matching from scratch and establishing a new team.
                        This demonstrates my ability to plan, organize, and allocate resources efficiently.
                        In school, I participated in lots of group projects, where I took the lead in coordinating teammates and managing deadlines, highlighting my time management, responsibility, and communication skills.

                    <h4>Agile & Growth-minded</h4>
                    <p>
                        My transition from Economics to Game Programming demonstrates that I am capable of quickly acquiring new knowledge.
                        Additionally, my experience working in start-up companies required me to manage different parts of team operations without guidance.
                        This meant I had to independently search for resources to accomplish my tasks.
                        In the fast-changing IT industry, I believe this adaptability is an essential skill for success.

                    <h4>Analytical & Solution-Oriented</h4>
                    <p>
                        During my studies, I consistently performed well in mathematics and programming, showcasing my strong problem-solving abilities.
                        As a customer service team leader in my past work experience, I was always the last resort for handling complaints.
                        This experience strengthened my problem-solving skills and ability to manage difficult situations effectively.
